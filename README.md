# WeRateDogs-data-wrangling-and-EDA
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of tweets from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. WeRateDogs is a popular Twitter account known for rating people's dogs with humorous comments. The aim is to gather, assess, clean, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights and trends.

# Datasets
The project uses three main datasets:

**Twitter Archive**
The Twitter archive dataset contains basic tweet data, including tweet ID, timestamp, text, rating, and dog stage information.

**Image Predictions**
The image predictions dataset includes predictions made by a neural network about the breed of the dog in each tweet, along with the confidence levels of these predictions.

**Tweet Data**
This dataset includes additional data on each tweet, such as the number of retweets and likes.

# Data Wrangling
The detailed wrangling process is documented in the file "wrangle_report.ipynb". This file includes a step-by-step description of how the data was collected,cleaned and prepared for analysis.

# Insights
The insights and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are documented in the file "act_report.ipynb". This file includes detailed analysis and visualizations derived from the cleaned data.
